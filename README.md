# Modern Natural Language Processing in Python

**Course Link:** <https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-nlp/>

## INFORMATION

* Solve Seq2Seq and Classification NLP tasks with Transformer and CNN using Tensorflow 2 in Google Colab
* Throughout this course, we will leverage the huge amount of speech and text data available online, and we will explore the main 3 and most powerful NLP applications, that will give you the power to successfully approach any real-world challenge.

1. First, we will dive into CNNs to create a sentimental analysis application.

2. Then we will go for Transformers, replacing RNNs, to create a language translation system.

## LEARNINGS

1. Build a Transformer, new model created by Google, for any sequence to sequence task (e.g. a translator)
2. Build a CNN specialized in NLP for any classification task (e.g. sentimental analysis)
3. Write a custom training process for more advanced training methods in NLP
4. Create customs layers and models in TF 2.0 for specific NLP tasks
5. Use Google Colab and Tensorflow 2.0 for your AI implementations
6. Pick the best model for each NLP task
7. Understand how we get computers to give meaning to the human language
8. Create datasets for AI from those data
9. Clean text data
10. Understand why and how each of those models work
11. Understand everything about the attention mechanism, lying behind the newest and most powerful NLP algorithms
